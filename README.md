## Current Projects

### LOADLIFT X1 PROTOTYPE DRONE ( MART 2024 - CONTINUE )
The LoadLift X1 is a drone prototype capable of carrying heavy loads between 3 to 5 kg (for example, almost a robotic dog) and transferring them to another location. The drone can stay airborne for approximately 15 minutes. While developing this prototype, I learned how to build a drone, select the right components to achieve the desired results, and configure the drone software.
